redfang 2.5 - the bluetooth hunter
(c)2003 @stake Inc

.intro
fang is a small proof-of-concept application to find non discoveredable
bluetooth devices. This is done by brute forcing the last six (6) bytes of 
the bluetooth address of the device and doing a read_remote_name().

this release of redfang now supports multiple threads and has now been 
modified for multiple devices and the code has been stream lined. It has 
been made a little more abstract. There is the start of an address parser that 
supports vendor+nnnnnn addresses, these exist in list.h.

this release of redfang was developed in collaboration with QinetiQ as part
of their work in the DTI Next Wave Technologies project FORWARD.
