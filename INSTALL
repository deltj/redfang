./redfang -n 4 -r start-finish -t timeout

note: 100000 is the timeout I have found anywhere between 25000 and 100000 
yield results. However 100000 will give reliable results (although slow)

The new default timeout is 25000 which seems alto lower. I have found that 
devices get missed on subsequent runs due to the dongles getting in a tiz.
The ./reinit program just downs then and reloads the drivers to make sure all
system calls are cleared. If you have problems with devices getting missed then
up the timeout as Ollie has suggested above.  This has only been tested on a 
T68i at present.

P.S. Please look at the ./reinit program it is pretty lame and may down devices
     you don't want it to.
